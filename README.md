So I am taking on the api routes and the routing. Based on what I have seen so far this is very similar to the week 14 challenge's routing section, I just have to make sure to change it so that it fits the posts and different things we are trying to route. In order to prepare for this task I planned to use the material I learned from the class project that is due for MVC and use that knowledge for the project as the routing and api routing are similar.
